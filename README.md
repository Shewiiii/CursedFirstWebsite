# CursedFirstWebsite
The first website I did for school in May 2023, but still updated when I'm bored.  
[Here is the website](https://shewi2.pythonanywhere.com/) (Warning: I can't write HTML/CSS, so it's probably very cursed)

## Subjects
At the beginning, the website was supposed to be a personnal blog (since it's my first website), but it quickly turned into an "audio nerd trying to explain things" website. Unfortunately, it's mostly in French. Everying is based on my knowledge I've gained by surfing the web (Forums, wikipedia, Youtube...) over the years. **There's nothing scientifically rigorous, so please take what I say with a grain of salt !**
* On [this page](https://shewi2.pythonanywhere.com/nerd) in French, I'm trying to explain how the process of audio reconstruction, from digital to analog works. I wrote this in May 2023, and the page probably needs some rework now.
  
  > During the reconstruction process, a Delta-sigma DAC uses Delta-sigma modulation before outputing an analog signal, but this topic isn't present on the page. Moreover, [a paper](https://secure.aes.org/forum/pubs/conventions/?ID=938) tried to prove that humans can't make the difference between native Hi-Res and CD quality audio, but this paper is the subject of much debate due to its lack of rigor. Though, even if this paper is incorrect, this doesn't change the fact that Hi-Res audio is useless, as I explain at the end of the page.
* On [this page](https://shewi2.pythonanywhere.com/gear) in English, I'm trying to explain why "sound quality" and "neutral sound" are not really objectively measurable things. For this, I explain how headphones and earphones can be measured, the variation in each individual's hearing, the huge limitations of these measurements, their misconceptions, and the inability to standardize them, to finally draw some conlucsions. The page is currently in Work-in-progress, everything is a bit unorganized.

## Plans for the future
* Finish the second page, and rework the HTML code.
* That's pretty much all.
